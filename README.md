## **Description.**

 As Clint eastwood says in Dirty harry that "Opinions are like a##holes, everbody's got one."....so i gotta give me opinion.
Obama was as i describe a inexperienced,islamofacists sympathizer, beta meta sort of guy like a Wolf in sheep's furr. He failed in Healthcare act, middle east, economics, imigration and was no less war criminal than Mr. Bush if we infer it according liberal logic.

 To demonstrate this i've performed **web scrapping** using **beautiful soup** (from a **wordpress blog** whose link is mentoined below) and **jupyter python** and then after that i used **Pandas library** in python to convert into data Frame. After converting them to data frame i projected that Data Frame into a **CSV(comma separated values) file.**

 Moreover, I also made Projected the scrapped data on a **txt file** named **final.txt** stored in same directory all this happened using python 

 Also i have demonstrated the output data in a **html file** stored in same directory.

 Furthermore if you're building any application and if you want to forecast this data then in that case you'll be need **JSON file** for this scrapped data and to facilitate this i've convert the scraped data into final.json file in a elegant manner and hence you need to make only **API calls** to get the data.

 There is a **images directory which contains images as a proof.**

 Algorithm for this project is written as a sort of explaination after every line in .ipynb file.
